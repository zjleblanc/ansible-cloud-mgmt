# Backing up the Platform

For any application, especially something as critical as Ansible Automation Platform (AAP), customers often need to have a backup process in place. The traditional, vm-based installer (setup.sh) for AAP also handles the backup process which can be scheduled to run by various mechanisms (same applies for bare-metal). Since we have AAP, why not Ansible? I finally got around to writing and scheduling my backups which includes an upload to S3 for storage purposes. In the future, the container-based installer backup process might look a bit different, but the workflow should still apply.

[The Playbook](../backup_platform.yml)

## The Process

1. Cleanup old backups (optional)
2. Create a backup directory
3. Run the setup script
4. Locate backup file using "latest" symlink
5. Upload to S3 (optional)
